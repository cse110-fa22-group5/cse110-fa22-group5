# Create main dashboard interface

## Context and Problem Statement

- Users are able to see/access the notes stored from local storage.
- Page should look simple and minimal.
- Users should be able to create new note from the homepage.

## Considered Options

- Using the table element
- Create customized element for note item

## Decision Outcome

We decide to create the custom element for each note element because it is easier, more adaptable, and dynamic when adding notes to the List element compared to using table element, which is static and hard to do so.
