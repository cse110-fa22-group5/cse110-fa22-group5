# Shape Up Reading

## Chapter 1: Introduction

**Six Week Cycle**

  - Work in 6 week cycles
  - Focus at a higher level (Do not count hours or days)
  - commit the six weeks and leave the team alone

**Shaping the work**

  - Narrowing down the problem and designing outline of a solution that fits within constraints
  - focus less on estimates and more on our appetite. ( How much is this idea worth?)
  - concrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves.

**Making teams responsible**

  - They define their own tasks, make adjustments to the scope, and work together to build vertical slices of the product one at a time.
  - Forms a virtuous cycle 
  - More autonomous -> less time managing -> shape up better projects -> clearer boundaries & work more autonomously
  
**Targeting risk**

  - risk of getting stuck
  - Every step of the process we have a specific target risk
  - Solve open questions *before* committing to a time frame, no rabbit holes or tangled interdependencies.
  - Integrating design and programming early, not build peices and intergrate them

# Shape (pre-work)

## Chapter 2: Principles of Shaping
Avoid two extremes (not too vague and not too concrete)

**Case study: The Dot Grid Calendar**
- only about 10% of customers used the feture of calendar. Not have the appetite 
  for spending six months on a calendar at first. 
- a tenth of what people think of when they say “calendar.” did the research, and narowed down  use case -> dot grid view
- not a full-featured calendar, it is okay with trade-offs

 - **Property 1: It's rough**
   
    - too early commits everyone to the wrong details
    - room to apply their own judgement and expertise
  - **Property 2: It's solved**

    - main elements of the solution are there at the macro level and they connect together
    - No open questions or rabbit holes to reduce project risk

  - **Property 3: It's bounded**
  -  limiting the scope and leaving specific things out.

**Who Shapes**

  - combining interface ideas with technical possibilities with business priorities
  - interaction design viewed from the user’s perspective
  - What are we trying to solve? Why does it matter? What counts as success? Which customers are affected? What is the cost of doing this instead of something else?
  - A closed door, creative, private, rough, earlyprocess

**Two tracks**

 
  - the teams are building work that’s been previously shaped and the shapers are working on what the teams might potentially build in a future cycle. 
  - Shaping track is kept private to give them the option to drop it or keep work in progress

**Steps to shaping** 

  - **1. Set boundaries**
  
    - how much time the raw idea is worth and how to define the problem
  - **2. Rough out the elements**

    - Sketching solution at higher level of abstraction than wireframes tp move fast and explore more

  - **3. Address risks and rabbit holes.**

    - Find holes or unanswered questions that could trip up the team
    - Amend solution and specify details for tricky spots to prevent wasting time

  - **4. Write the pitch.**
  
    - summarizes the problem, constraints, solution, rabbit holes, and limitations
    - Pitch goes to the betting table for consideration

## Chapter 3: Set Boundaries
**Setting the appetite**
- stop tp think about how valuable the idea is
- explicitly define how much of our time and attention the subject deserves (fix/entire cycle/accomodate/minor tweak)
- Appetite: time budget for a standard team size: appetite: small batch(batch together to a six week cycle)/big batch(break off and shape to a six-week appetite)

**Fixed time, variable scope**
- start with a number and end with a design
- tension between time, quality, and scope (have a deadline first)
- pressure of the fixed deadline -> without extra sections -> time to fix the quality issues
- make decisions about what is core to the project and what is peripheral or unnecessary.

**“Good” is relative**
- can only judge what is a “good” solution in the context of how much time we want to spend and how important it is.
- relative to the constraints with a time limit
  
**Responding to raw ideas**
-  too early to say “yes” or “no” on first contact.
-  work on the idea before it’s shaped enough to bet resources on
-  keep a cool manner (don’t want to shut down an idea that we don’t understand / not showing too much enthusiasm and committing it right away)

**Narrow down the problem**
- creating more complex permission rules(more than 6 weeks) ->  put a warning on the archive action itself that explains the impact(one-day change)
- six weeks instead of six months building a huge calendar -> narrow it down, what is driving the request, what is the influence without it that they are asking for?

**Case study: Defining “calendar”**
- when she wanted a calendar
- What was she doing when the thought occurred to ask for it?
- Instead of when and what
- insight wasn’t “computerize the calendar”/“do everything a calendar does.” but “see free spaces”
- narrowed down the need from “do everything a calendar does” to “help me see free spaces so I can figure out when to schedule something.”
- specific enough to spark an idea that could fit within our appetite. 

**Watch out for grab-bags**
- “redesigns” or “refactorings” -> grab-bag
- What’s not working? In what context are there too many steps? What parts of the existing design can stay the same and what parts need to change?

**Boundaries in place**
- a raw idea, an appetite, and a narrow problem definition -> move on

## Chapter 4: Find the Elements

**Move at the right speed**
- right people—or nobody—in the room
- avoid the wrong level of detail in the drawings and sketches
- breadboarding and fat marker sketches. (quickly draw different versions of entire flows )
**Breadboarding**
- sketch and discuss the key components and connections of an interface idea without specifying a particular visual design.
- Places: navigate, like screens, dialogs, or menus that pop up.
- Affordances: user can act on, like buttons and fields.
- Connection lines: how the affordances take the user from place to place.

**Example**
- Invoice tool -> add a new autopay feature 
- have deeper questions and discussions prompted by just a few words and arrows in the breadboard.
- lightweight notation:  quickly jump around and entertain different possibilities.

**Fat marker sketches**
-  a sketch made with such broad strokes that adding detail is difficult or impossible. (pen size set to a large diameter.)
-  avoid  easily skipping ahead to the wrong level of fidelity
  
**Elements are the output**
- list of elements is extremely narrow and specific 
  
**Room for designers**
- leaving details out, give room to designers in subsequent phases of the project.
- making the project more specific and concrete, but still leaving lots of space for decisions and choices to be made later. 
  
**Not deliverable yet**
- stress-testing and de-risking
- check for holes and challenges that could hinder the project from shipping within the fixed time appetite
  
**No conveyor belt**
- still haven’t bet on it, or made any commitments or promises about it.
## Chapter 5: Risks and Rabbit Holes
**Different categories of risk**
-  well-shaped work -> a thin-tailed probability distribution.
-  any rabbit holes in the shaping—technical unknowns, unsolved design problems, or misunderstood interdependencies— right tail stretches out.
  
**Look for rabbit holes**
-  slow down and walk through a use case in slow motion from the starting point to the end to reveal gaps or missing pieces.
  
**Case study: Patching a hole**
- In to-do list, not addressing how to display completed items, completed items at the bottom of each group instead of the list? How?
- not responsible to give the team a tangled knot of interdependencies and ask them to untangle it within a short fixed time window.
- dictate a solution in the shaped concept, just append the name of the group to each completed item at the end.
- Trade-off here, a little bit messy, but simplifird the problem, and still show completed items from a group on the group’s detail page.
- thinking less about the ultimate design and more about basic quality and risk. 
  
**Declare out of bounds**
- scope hammering : forcefully questioning a design, implementation, or use case to cut scope and finish inside the fixed time box
- group notification -> assigning a to-do, or mentioning people in the chat room? instead of choose a group
- core value was narrowing down who to notify about a message.
- the other cases as “out of bounds” for the project 
  
**Cut back**
- color-code groups as unnecessary and cut it from the core of the project. 
- This is a nice-to-have, but the feature is valuable without it.
  
**Present to technical experts**
- good time to grab some technical experts and walk them through the idea
- find out if it’s possible within the appetite we’re shaping for. 
- Instead of asking “is it possible to do X?” ask “is X possible in 6-weeks?” 
- emphasize that you’re looking for risks that could blow up the project.
- invite them to a whiteboard and redraw the elements as you worked them out earlier, building up the concept from the beginning.
- ask them do they have any insights about how to drastically simplify or approach the problem differently?
  
**De-risked and ready to write up**
- go from a roughly formed solution with potential risk in it to a solid idea that we now hope to bet on in the future.
- from privately shaping and getting feedback from an inner-circle to presenting the idea at the betting table
## Chapter 6: Write the Pitch
put the concept into a form that other people will be able to understand, digest, and respond to.

**Ingredient 1. Problem**
- The raw idea, something we’ve seen that motivates us to work on this
- Always present both a problem and a solution together.
- Establishing the problem and think about the solution. 
- The best problem definition consists of a single specific story that shows why the status quo doesn’t work.
- Baseline: what customers are doing without the thing we're currently building
- people will be weigh the solution against this specific problem
  
**Ingredient 2. Appetite**
- How much time we want to spend and how that constrains the solution
- prevents unproductive conversations.
- takes work and design insight to get to a simple idea that fits in a small time box.
- time constraint

**Ingredient 3. Solution**
- The core elements we came up with
- A problem without a solution is unshaped work, need to go back and do the shaping work on the shaping track. 
- only ready to bet on when problem, appetite, and solution come together. 
  
**Help them see it**
- stay high level, but add a little more concreteness than when we worked alone or with a partner
- need more concreteness, but not want to over-specify the design with wireframes or high-fidelity mocks. (no color, layout...)
  
**Embedded sketches**
- Designers should feel free to find a different design
- breadboard -> a new box on the dashboard ->  selectively getting into more visual detail
  
**Annotated fat marker sketches** 
- take more care to label them cleanly.
- use different colors to separate the labels from the material parts of the sketch.
  
**Ingredient 4. Rabbit holes**
- Details about the solution worth calling out to avoid problems
- just requires a few lines of text, spelling it out patches a potential rabbit hole.
  
**Ingredient 5. No Gos**
- Anything specifically excluded from the concept
- mention when there’s anything we’re not doing in this concept
  
**Examples**
- Two screenshots demonstrate the problem. Fat marker sketches describe the solution. Rabbit holes motivated some of the sketches.
- Two videos show the problem. A fat marker sketch and a breadboard describe the solution. The black boxes contain data visualizations that support trade-offs in the solution.
  
**Ready to present**
- posting the write-up with all the ingredients above somewhere that stakeholders can read it on their own time. 
- ready to pull up for a quick live sell.
  
**How we do it in Basecamp**
- People comment on the pitch asynchronously. Not to say yes or no — that happens at the betting table — but to poke holes or contribute missing information.
