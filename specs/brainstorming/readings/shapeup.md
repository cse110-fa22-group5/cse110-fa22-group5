# Shape Up Reading

- Founder of Basecamp

- Book of basic truths
  - Understand the risks, uncertainties and challenges that come up in product dev
- Specific processes used to make meaningful progress on products

## Ch 1: Outline

**Six Week Cycle**

- Work in 6 week cycles
- Use time wisely
- Most new features are built in one 6 week cycle
- Dont rethink roadmap every 2 weeks
- Its all about focus at a higher level

**Shaping the work**

- Narrowing down the problem and designing outline of a solution that fits within constraints
- Shape the work before giving it to a team
- Right level of vague and concrete for teams

**Making teams responsible**

- They define their own tasks
- Different from where managers subdivide work and coders are like ticket-takers
- Forms a virtuous cycle
- More autonomous teams -> senior people manage them less -> they can shape up better projects -> teams have clearer boundaries & work more autonomously

**Targeting risk**

- Not risk of building the wrong thing, but risk of not shipping in time
- Every step of the process we have a specific target risk
- Solve open questions _before_ committing to a time frame
- Capping bets at 6 weeks
- Projects dont get an extension after 6 weeks
- Integrating design and programming early
- No disconnecteed parts, we all work on one meaningful piece of work and repeat

## Ch.2: Principles of Shaping

- Need right level of abstraction: not too vague and not too concrete

**Wireframes are too concrete**

- Design leaders shouldn't go straight to wireframes or high fidelity markups
- Too much detail too early leaves designers no room for creativity
- Over specifying the design can lead to estimation errors
- Team should solve hidden complexities and implementation details that weren't visible in the mockup

**Words are too abstract**

- Too vague don't work either for projects
- Team members dont have enough info to make trade offs
- Under specified projects naturally grow out of contol since no boundaries to define what's outside of the scope
- They dont know what to leave out or include

**Case study: The Dot Grid Calendar**

- Version 3 Basecamp didn't have calender, customer wanted calendar
- Calenders can take up to 6 months to produce, lots of complexities
- They didn't have the appetite for spending 6 months on one, since only 10% of customers used them in past versions
- They only have 6 weeks to work with: they could only build a tenth of what people think of when they say "calender"
- Came up with the Dot Grid:

  - Not a full featured calendar
  - Comfortable with tradeoffs because of use case
  - Specific idea, rough sketch with design
  - This example highlights a few properties of shaped work

- **Properties of shaped work 1: Its rough**

  - Shaping stage is rough
  - Lots of open spaces and unfinished
  - Designers & coders need to apply their own judgement and expertise to uncover all the real tradeoffs here

- **Property 2: It's solved**

  - Despite being unfinished and rough, all main elements are there
  - Overall solution is spelled out
  - Any open questions or rabbit holes they can see up front removed to reduce project risk

- **Property 3: It's bounded**

  - Shaped works shows what _not_ to do
  - Tells the team where to stop
  - Specific appetite i.e. amount of time the team is allowed to spend on it
  - Requires limiting scope and leave some things out
  - Roughness: leaves room for team to resolve all details
  - Solution & boundaries: act like guard rails, they reduce risk and channel the team's effort

**Who Shapes**

- Shaping is creative and integrative
- Combines interface ideas and technicial possibilities with business priorities
- Design work from the _user's perspective_
- Need to technically literate, not necessarily a coder
- Strategic work
- A closed door, creative process

**Two tracks**

- Can't really schedule shaping because unshaped work is risky and unknown
- Any 6 week cycle you have teams working on work thats been previously shaped
- Shapers are working on what the teams next cycle is
- Shaping track is kept private to give them the option to drop it or keep it going

**Steps to shaping**

- **1. Set boundaries**

  - Define the problems and set boundaries to shape into

- **2. Rough out the elements**

  - Sketching solution at higher level of abstraction then wireframes
  - So we can move fast and explore a wide possibilities
  - Output of this step: idea that solves the problem without details

- **3. Address risks and rabbit holes.**

  - Find holes or unanswered questions that could trip up the team
  - Amend solution and specify details for those tricky spots to prevent team from getting stuck/wasting time

- **4. Write the pitch.**

  - Once its shaped enough to be a potential bet, create formal write up _pitch_
  - Pitch summaries the problem, constraints, solution, rabbit holes, and limitations
  - Pitch goes to the betting table for consideration
  - Once pitch is chosen it can be reused to explain project to the team
