**Brainstorm activity on canvas:**

- What is expected for this activity
- TAs will go over this Wednesday
- There is a certain way to perform this brainstorm activity
- Today Priyanka will just explain the overview
- Tomorrow will be more detailed expectations of this 
- Giving team more time
- Brainstorm activity goes towards your project idea
- This week take time and do brainstorm activity to work towards project pitch
- She will let us know how to properly pitch ideas
- Next week will finalize 
- Some project ideas may not work for course requirements
- We will have time to make changes to pitch if needed
- She wants all members to build starting pitch presentation
- Whoever is present, everyones participates in starting pitch to clearly understand team idea and how its presented
- Next week: Present ideas and work around it, finalize it and prepare pitch for canvas submission
- She will give us a template to give ideas for how to present pitch and for her to understand if we need to change anything to it
- Canvas has a template format 
- *2 pitches* to give: One is a starting pitch for one idea, and Tuesday stick with 2 ideas
- Prove to her that this idea fulfills the requirements for the project which you can find on the powerpoint lecture slides
- One requirement: use application without internet also, internet should not be the core focus
- Note taking app will not need internet 
- API: News app with support of API will not work without internet to fetch live news
- Limit ideas in such a way that it matches the requirements of the project
  
**How does everyone work with GH?:**

- We should create our own branch and issues
- Example: Meeting notes should have issue & branch
- Once its reviewed, someone would branch to main
- To avoid possibilities of overriding others' work
- Pattern should be followed for any push to GH
  
 **Daily standups:**

- Did we all get a chance to try it out? 
- Whatever you respond those get posted on a daily standup channel, kept public so we know who is working on what part of the course
- There may be a case where someone else is working on the same issue so its good to monitor and keep it a practice and habit to check everyones responses
  
**Clarification on our 2 ideas discussed Saturday 10/16**

- Refresh would happen with internet
- Local refresh is possible where you have anyone posting about a product they want to sell - local storage
- Easily refresh the application the user sees so anytime you see a new post
- These could be ok with API endpoint otherwise you'd have to write a script locally to see if theres new prodcuts selling
- If yes, then show those new products thats a local refresh which may be tedious if you dont have a background knowledge
- Suggest to Priya: Talk to professor after class to get viewpoints so you can get one more perspective
- Team members suggests it may not work without internet: Do you still think not doing the project just for this reason may not 
- 5 weeks: project may be difficult to do but as long as you keep it basics
- Stay minimalistic and realistic
- high achieving goal may not be able to do due to realistic standards
- dont overplan or overachieve, just ber realistic 
- Basic website with basic CSS
- Thats how you talk to stakeholders, once you commit thats the final decision
- I dont want you to rush in developing ideas you dont have a chance to go back because this a small 10 week course
- 10 week we will finalize project and we will work around it
- Its possible to do this: the design is similar to note taking app 
- Here you have create a note: create a post
- update a note: update the post 
- But my idea would have authentications, with price
- Other users wont have access to our post, same with note taking
- Your notes are your notes nobody else could see that
- Selling and buying idea is public
- limit access to who can update and delete - restricted access (both note taking and marketplace)
- Small details to consider in design issues
- Focus on this instead of high level as to how to design would look like 
- Once we're done with brainstorm activity our minds might change
