# Main Ideas:

- things to include
  - start time and date
  - Members in meeting
  - Purpose of meeting
  - What did we plan to discuss during this meeting?
  - Any decisions made
  - Conflicts
    - How were these conflicts resolved? (majority or weighing pros and cons)
- Purpose of these notes: helps show how team is progressing
  - Want everyone to contribute to these notes!
  - Rotation or shared doc
- TA is here to help the project/presentation
- We are responsible for starting the assignments, and being aware of all deadlines (ie on Canvas)
- Group assignments only need 1 submitter unless specified otherwise

# Project deets:

- Refer to slides from prof and think of a product for week 4
- Think of how to approach
- How does it look
- How does it function
- Roles for members
- Roles are suggested by TA (available via team leads), but they are optional
- Flexible, can change roles later on
- Keep track of these changes, roles should be clear to everyone
- Use basic tools. Don't spend too much time on advanced tools that are too hard to nav
- CRUD
- Domain: personal info management
- Examples:
- Notes that keep track of who created them
- User auth to know which user logs in
- Once logged in, perform certain actions (creating recipe, etc,)
- associated with specific user
- Need to be able to fetch user data
- Website should be functional

### Some early thoughts:

- Where to store data, local/cloud?
- how?
- Think of ideas like recipe manager, calendar notes, etc etc.
- Think of extra functionality like sharing, translation support, etc.
