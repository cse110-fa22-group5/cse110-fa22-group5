<!-- Topics for the meeting-->
# Agenda
- Brainstorm activity & Starting pitch

<!-- homework basically zzzz-->
# Things to do for next meeting:
- Get started on brainstorm activity to be able to do starting pitch

<!-- what was discussed for each topic-->
# Main Ideas:
- Is project idea have functionality
- Choose 1-2 idea in your mind 
- High level description so its easy for us to start working on brainstorm activity
- Certain meeting notes to prepare:
- date time format of md file
- How long did this meeting go? Who conducted it? Participants? Conflicts? Decision conflicts and how are we going aroung it?
- Generally use a whiteboard
- Miro or classroom- take pictures of it to later upload
- Many other whiteboard tools available 
- When we work as a team, we will design and draw architectures/functionalities
- Create a dir structure of brainstorm.md
- Whiteboard should go under specs directory for diagrams and tools
- Use a whiteboard while doing the brainstorm activity
- Define users for idea and features the system would need to address
- DONT think of longterm features yet!
- Note taking app: allows us to follow all the SWE principles
- Think of basic functionality: 
- Create, read, update, delete
- Then you can later have features of sharing, downloading
- Create future goals or future ideas to develop later
- Its architecture and design as well
- ADI folder for every feature we design, will do in subsequent weeks
- What would be the input from user to do this particular architecture design?
- Small details as we develop features
- User centered thinking documents: 
- Creating user stories, we define being in a user's position
- What button clicks does the user have to perform to do these actions
- Good practice to show them warnings: Error Prevention
- System diagrams: Wont go in depth right away, will develop in subsequent weeks
- Start brainstorm activity right away! 
- Pitch ppt presentation could follow the template as the starting pitch so we don't have to put more effort to submit it to canvas
- Tell her the risk, things we're worried about for certain functionalities
- Don't pick a topic and show her its the "best" topic because you wont have a chance to change it later
- Keep it minimal, basic
- If you're able to achieve it in time, then you can always add more functionality
- Starting pitch: pdf or ppt
- Ppt would be better in her opinion but its upto us
- As long as the doc mentions major keypoints that we pitch to Priyanka
- Do not try to do the starting pitch before the brainstorm activity is completed! 
- Dont email or slack msg her the pitch document
- Should be on GH
- Starting pitch ideas early to her so we have time to prepare our presentation
- **GH Tips: Software Lifecycle Principles**
- Grading depends on this
- How well we follow this is the key of this course
- Maintain all code, documents, directories in GH
- Main branch or master branch
- Given 10 team members and everyone is coding on a certain functionality: 
- You wouldnt want to push code to GH directly to the main branch: INCORRECT!
- You should have your own branch on the GH
- Proper template in what way you would create a branch
- Name-FunctionalityName
- Readable branch name & what its purpose is for
- Once you want to push your code, make sure to pull the code with main before so you're up to date with everything
- Push your code to your branch, then create a pull request
- Pull request: You are asking a senior on the team to review your changes and only merge when its finalized to main branch
- Only main goes to the production
- Very difficult to revert the code pieces
- Once you create a pull request, assign someone to review it (have someone on a rotation basis)
- Issues, custom template 
- Create an issue, assign a proper label and assign to your pull request
- When she grades our project she can see the issues
- Open issues will let her know where the project is currently
- Every change you make is an issue thats why you're making these code changes
- BRANCHES: DELETE BRANCHES ONCE YOU'RE DONE
- Unless its a general branch like *Meeting Notes* or something
