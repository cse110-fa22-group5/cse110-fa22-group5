  - List of Notes
  - Fetching Notes from storage (update dashboard)
  - Title
  - UI, frontend heavy task
  - EDIT button here for mass deleting notes on the dashboard (different from edit button for editing actual notes)
    - Maybe like a select button, then u can select multiple notes and delete is an option
